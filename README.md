# dyedetector
Script for comparing cell dye density that tolerates voids. This uses a Gaussian Mixture Model to classify colors, calibrates an appropriate moving average window size, and provides graphs for area above threshold between samples.

detector.py works now, but is a bit out of order. this is being reworked in analyze\_relative\_density
no arguments atm, need to manually assign file paths.
